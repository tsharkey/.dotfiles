# README.md
A collection of dotfiles and configurations to make my development environment "portable"

# Install
Maybe just have the install script open these pages
- vscode
- bear notes
- iterm nord theme

# TODO: Unanswered questions
- how to sync vs code properly
- how to sync alfred properly
- how to sync iterm properly
- setup gitconfig and global gitignore
- setup linking for all of the tooling config files

# What scripts do I want to add here?

# TODO:
install script
add scripts folder to path
get command for installing iterm2 nord theme
consider getting dropbox, it might make it easier to sync everything from there

# Order of Operations
- run brew install script
  - probably should make sure that I also have brew installed already and that it is up to date
- run mas install script
- setup mac os defaults
- symlink all the dotfile
